# books-recommandation
Books recommandation in Python using books-dataset from user saurabhbagchi on Kaggle website
Sadly, "This dataset has been compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler in 2004"

Open for contribution, but let me finish first what I'm writing :)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python .\main.py
```

Not enough data sadly to recommand something. Gotta work on the new dataset :(
(also, had issues with big csv files using pandas)
